14	Sonnet 18	Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?`Thou art more lovely and more temperate:`Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,`And summer's lease hath all too short a date;`Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,`And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;`And every fair from fair sometime declines,`By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;`But thy eternal summer shall not fade,`Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;`Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,`When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st:`So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,`So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.`
15	Lady Macbeth, Macbeth 1.5	Come, you spirits`That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,`And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full`Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;`Stop up the access and passage to remorse,`That no compunctious visitings of nature`Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between`The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,`And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,`Wherever in your sightless substances`You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,`And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,`That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,`Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,`To cry 'Hold, hold!'`
